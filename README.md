## Brief Description
Search for new meal and cocktail recipes. Favorite the ones you love to save them for later. For those nights when it doesnâ€™t turn out quite right or you don't want to cook, simply look up restaurants in your area.

## User Story
As a user, I want to find recipes for meals and cocktails. I want to be able to save my favorites to find later. If it goes terribly wrong, I want to find a restaurant as a back-up plan.

When I search for a meal or cocktail recipe, then I am presented with a gallery of results. When I click on a recipe, it takes me to the full recipe. Recipes are presented with a favorite icon. When I click on the favorite icon, the recipe is saved to my favorites. When I go to my favorites, I can see a gallery of all of the recipes that I favorited. Then I can click on them to go to the full recipe. When I search for a restaurant type, I am presented with a list of restaurants. When I click on a restaurant, it opens a detailed description, hours, and a link to the website in a seperate page. I can also click on a favorite icon for restaurants and view a gallery of my favorites.
